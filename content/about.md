## Nature of Content

The sport of professional badminton is colorful and naturally diverse.
Badminton Wiki aims to present a collection of observations of high-level badminton.
This information does not take the stance to be solemnly correct nor should it present personal
opinions of the editors.
The nature of information is meant to be observatory but also explanatory.
This means that on one hand, we aim to provide all observed techniques and tactics while on the
other, we try to explain the motivation behind these choices.

## References

Every statement or observation should be validated by credible sources.
These sources can range from books to scientific papers, interviews or youtube videos.
It is important that the source material is published in such a way that it is unlikely to be
removed or migrated elsewhere in the future.
This is particularly important for interviews and news articles which may be subject to relocation.
