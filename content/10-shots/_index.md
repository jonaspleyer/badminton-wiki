Shots in badminton can be categorized in different ways.
The cases presented below allow to classify almost all shots which we observe.
It is important to note that these classifications have been chosen for clarity and it is clear that
many shots will lie in a continuous spectrum between the designated classifications.

## Point of Contact

One approach is to distinguish between the height at which the shuttle is struck.
We differentiate between high, medium and low points of contact.
A high point of contact is usually at the height of the shoulder or above while a low point of
contact is classified as knee-height or below.
All remaining shots are considered medium height.

## Position in Court

<img width="60%" src="court-markers.png" alt="picture of a badminton court"/>

Shots performed from the front of the court are fundamentally different to ones from the middle or
the back.
Fron-court shots need comparatively less energy to target the full court and are thus easy to learn
even for beginners.
They require less technical movements but need to be treated with more finesse.
As one moves from the front to the back, shots requires more energy and thus more complex techniques
are employed to meet these needs.
Typically, one distinguishes between 3 positions from the back of the court to the front together
with forehand (FH) and backhand (BH) sides, coming to a total of 6 combinations.

| Rear-Court, Backhand | Mid-Court, Backhand | Front-Court, Backhand |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Rear-Court, Forehand** | **Mid-Court, Forehand** | **Front-Court, Forehand** |

From a tactical perspective, shots from the middle have to be distinguished from shots from the
sides but the technical element does only change insignificantly.

## Objective of the Shot

In addition to the aforementioned classifications, each shot serves a particular objective.
They can be classified into 4 main classes (see also [tactics/principles](/tactics/principles)):

1. Attack: Put pressure on your opponent
2. Neutralize: Bring rally to a neutral situation
3. Defend: Recover from under pressure
4. Counter: Turn an opponents attack against them

Sometimes, the last classification is treated as a combination of 2 and 1.
Given a certain point of impact and position in court, players usually have more than one option to
meet the objective of their shot.
I.e. an attacking shot from a high forehand position can be played as a smash, half-smash, deception
or other.
But they might also be limited in their choice depending on the situation and their technical
capabilities.

### Hard vs Soft Shots

Shots can also be distinguished into hard and soft shots which mainly refers to the speed of the
shuttle.
This distinction is especially useful for mid-court shots such as drives and pushes.
A harder shot will usually be associated with an attacking or counter-offensive shot while soft
ones can be classified as neutralizing or defending.
