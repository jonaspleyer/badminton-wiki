Shots in badminton can be categorized by different perspectives.
The cases presented below allow to classify almost all shots which be observe.
It is important to note that the classes have been chosen for clarity and it is clear that most
shots will be on a continuous spectrum between them.

## Point of Impact

A popular approach is to distinguish between the height at which the shuttle is struck.
We differentiate between high, medium and low points of impact.
A high point of impact is usually at the height of the shoulder or above while a low point of impact
is classified as knee-height or below.
All remaining shots are considered medium height.

## Position in Court

Shots performed from the front of the court are fundamentally different to ones from the middle or
the back.
Fron-court shots need comparatively less energy to target the full court and are thus easy to learn
even for beginners.
They require less technical movements but need to be treated with more finesse.
As one moves from the front to the back, shots requires more energy and thus more complex techniques
are employed to meet these needs.

## Objective of the Shot

In addition to the aforementioned classifications, each shot serves a particular objective.
They can be classified into 3 main classes:

1. Attack: Put pressure on your opponent
2. Neutralize: Absorb aggression from the opponent
3. Counter: Turn an opponents attack against them
4. Preserve: Keeps the rally going

Given a certain point of impact and position in court, players usually have more than one option to
meet the objective of their shot.
I.e. an attacking shot from a high forehand position can be played as a smash, half-smash, deception
or other.
