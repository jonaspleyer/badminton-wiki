Learning and mastering the footwork in badminton is a vital component in every player's arsenal.
It is very natural for new players to focus on learning new shots rather than to implement proper
footwork technique.
However, in many games (especially in the singles disciplines) it is more important to keep the
rally going rather than to be able to put pressure on your opponent.

But strong footwork is also important for health reasons.
It allows players to properly distribute the physical pressure on the body and prevents injuries.
